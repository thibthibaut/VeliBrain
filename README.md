# VelibHeatMap (or VHM)
This project aims to track the density of velib (bicycle sharing system) in Paris.
### How does it work ?
Good question.
### Thank you, but how does it work ?
Like that :
* First, we record the data from the OpenDataParis API during 48 hours (Recording stared on Tue Mar 22 2016 22:56:06 GMT+0100)
* Then, we'll display a dynamic heatmap thanks to GoogleMaps visualization API
### And then ?
We'll see.
